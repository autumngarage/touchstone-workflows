# Touchstone Workflows

Protected source for organization-required GitHub Actions workflows. Target
repositories execute these workflows from immutable commit SHAs, so a pull
request cannot weaken its own merge gate by editing a same-named local file.

Changes to `main` require a pull request. Touchstone's audited GitHub policy
owns which source repository, path, and full commit SHA are required.

The required job downloads `scripts/touchstone-run.sh` from a full Touchstone
commit SHA, verifies its pinned SHA-256 digest, and runs the target repository's
`.touchstone.toml` declaration. Consumers carry declarations only: they do not
copy the validator or own the authoritative workflow.

## Source contract

`.touchstone-source-contract.json` is the versioned boundary between this
repository and Touchstone's source policy. It names every top-level workflow,
the workflow and job that publish the `source contract` status, and the exact
required-check name. `tests/test-workflow.sh` refuses missing, extra, nested, or
duplicate workflow declarations and verifies that only the declared publisher
owns that status.

Pull requests land through the repository's merge queue only after the source
contract check passes. Touchstone separately pins each consumer-required
workflow to an immutable commit from this repository.
