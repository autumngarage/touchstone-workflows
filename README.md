# Touchstone Workflows

Protected source for organization-required GitHub Actions workflows. Target
repositories execute these workflows from immutable commit SHAs, so a pull
request cannot weaken its own merge gate by editing a same-named local file.

Changes to `main` require a pull request. Touchstone's audited GitHub policy
owns which source repository, path, and full commit SHA are required.

The required job downloads `scripts/touchstone-run.sh` from a full Touchstone
commit SHA, verifies its pinned SHA-256 digest, and runs the target repository's
`.touchstone.toml` declaration. Consumers carry declarations only: they do not
copy the validator or own the authoritative workflow.
